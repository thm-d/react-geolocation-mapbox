# What about this project

This mini-project allowed me to manipulate the Mapbox API via React.
The CSS part was handled with TailwindCSS.
Obviously, there's still a lot of room for improvement in the project, with many potential features to be implemented, but what interested me here was establishing a few basic map-related functionalities.


# Getting Started with Geolocation Application

- The application has two default contacts
- A simple click on the map will open a popup to enter a new contact on the map by validating the form
- It will not be possible to validate the form if a field is missing
- If you wish to leave the popup, click "cancel" or click outside the popup
- Clicking on a point already displayed on the map or on an item in the "contacts" section will open an information sheet that you can close by clicking outside the popup
- The data will be persisted in your browser's localstorage
- To reset the data, click on "reset data"
